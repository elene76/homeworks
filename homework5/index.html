                <p>Back in 2015, ALOHAS was founded in Hawaii to put a twist on espadrilles - the quintessential Spanish
                    summer shoe. Since then, we have taken a break from the heat to develop fall/winter collections too,
                    as well as clothing and accessories. Step by step, our style has evolved to incorporate both trendy
                    silhouettes and timeless icons with a focus on sustainability.</p>

                <h2>DESIGNED IN BARCELONA</h2>
                <p>
                    Proudly Spanish since birth, our shoes are designed in Barcelona and meticulously crafted by local
                    artisans. Drawing on timeless trends that can last a lifetime, each design is a testament to our
                    commitment to both style and innovationâ€“all while maintaining an avant-garde spirit.</p>
                <h1>WHAT IS *ON DEMAND*?</h1>
                <p>
                    It's the way we do everything. From the moment an idea is born, we use our pre-order system to
                    forecast demand levels prior to production. We only produce what you actually want to buy, which
                    means no waste of materials.
                    Here's how it works:</p>
                <h3>on_demand</h3>
                <p>
                    We launch new collections at 30% off.
                    Why do we launch at a discount? To encourage you to shop on demand.
                <h3>pre_order</h3>

                <p>Production begins and the discount drops to 15%.
                    Why is the discount lowered? Because you placed your order after production began.</p>
